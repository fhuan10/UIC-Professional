UIC Connect ++ 
Created by: Oli Kosiacki, Rovia Simmons, Flora Huang, and Nilufar Lakada
  This project allows UIC students to search for alumni and message them in website. Students also can see career events happenign at UIC along with additional resources to help them continue their academic careers.

  UIC Connect ++ bridges the connection between alumni, professors, and UIC students. Currently, it's difficult to acccess both alumni and career events together. Students need a way to talk to alumni who are willing to provide insights to students who are looking ahead to their future.
  
  Once logged in, the users are able to click the navigation bar to an event page showing calendar of events and events happening on the current day. There is also a connect page allowing users to look for alumni through tags such as their major. The bar also includes a resource page to list additional resources helpful to the student.
  Once in the connect page, the user can click an alumni and see their personal descriptions in case they have additional information.
  
In case of issue, users can contact the following:
okosi3@uic.edu
nlaka2@uic.edu
fhuang22@uic.edu
rsimm5@uic.edu

The developing team that will maintain:
okosi3@uic.edu
nlaka2@uic.edu
fhuang22@uic.edu
rsimm5@uic.edu

Currently, the functionality is low-level but if continued, UIC can take ownership and implement their own database of alumni and the microsoft login info
